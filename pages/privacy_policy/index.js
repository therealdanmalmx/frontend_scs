            <p className="mt-2">We collect information about you when you visit this website. We automatically collect information on your user behavior and your interaction with us. We also log data about your computer or mobile device. We collect, store, and use data about every access of our online offer (so-called server logfiles). This access data includes the name and URL of the accessed file, the date and time of access, the volume of transferred data, the successful access report (HTTP response code), the browser type and version, the operating system, the referrer URL (i.e. the previously visited page), the IP address, and the enquiring provider.</p>
            <p className="mt-2">We use this log data, without associating it with your person and without any other kind of profile creation, for statistical analyses for operational purposes, the security and optimization of our online offer, but also for anonymously logging the number of visitors to our website (traffic), and the extent and type of use of our website. This information allows us to analyze data traffic, find and fix bugs, and improve our services. We reserve the right to check log data after the fact if, based on concrete evidence, there is a justified suspicion of illegal use. We save IP addresses in the log files for a limited period if this serves security purposes (e.g. when you are using one of our offers). We also save IP addresses if there is concrete suspicion of a criminal offence in connection with the use of our website.</p>

            <p className="mt-2">We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”. These are text files stored on your computer, which allow the analysis of your use of the website. Information created by a cookie about the visitor’s use of this website is generally sent to and stored on Google’s servers located in the USA.</p>
            <p className="mt-2">If you are located in the European Union or in a signatory country of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, it is possible to use IP anonymization on this web page to shorten your IP address before transmission. Only in exceptional cases will the complete IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. IP anonymization is activated on this website. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity, and provide us with other website and Internet-related services.</p>
            <p className="mt-2">Google does not associate the IP address transmitted by your browser with other data within the scope of Google Analytics. You can change your browser setting to prevent the storage of cookies. However, doing so may also prevent you from using some or all features provided by this website.</p>
            <p className="mt-2">You can prevent Google from collecting and processing data generated by the cookie and data related to your use of this website (incl. your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plugin available from the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">Google opt-out</a>.</p>
